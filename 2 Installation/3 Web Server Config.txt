Web Server Configuration


1 Directory Configuration

2 Pretty URLs

  2.1 Apache
  Laravel includes a public/.htaccess file that is used to provide URLs without the index.php front controller in the path
  Before serving Laravel with Apache, be sure to enable the mod_rewrite module so the .htaccess file will be honored by the server.

  If the .htaccess file that ships with Laravel does not work with your Apache installation, try this alternative:

  Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
  RewriteEngine On

  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
  RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]


  2.2 Nginx
  If you are using Nginx, the following directive in your site configuration will direct all requests to the index.php front controller:

  location / {
      try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
  }

  When using Homestead or Valet, pretty URLs will be automatically configured.
